# alexa-skill-experiments

A collection of experimental Alexa Skill & Lambda applications with some notes and whatnot.

# History

I bought an Echo Dot to control some WiFi-enabled lights and switches. And after playing with it I decided that learning how to create a *decent* Alexa skill.

# Purpose

This repository contains some experiments that are intended either as Skill applications or as *support* software. I don't guarantee that **anything** here actually works. But something does does work and it's usable I'll likely create a repository specifically for it.
